Step by step TypeScript retrieves a new useful features such a generic types, decorators, namespaces, abstraction levels e.c. But one of the truly cool things, which may significantly improve code readability is modules system.

If you have an experience with AMD (*Asynchronous module definition, AMD*), undoubtedly you've worked with big JavaScript application systems. Here is the simple example:

```javascript
define(function (require, exports, module) {
     var a = require('a'),
         b = require('b');

     exports.action = function () {};
   });
```

Now it does not matter, what exactly code above means. Just try to be aware of that feature in JavaScript before it was implemented into TypeScript.

### TypeScript & modules

So, modules can help you manage big applications, separate a specific block of codes into independent functional entities and decrease time for debugging. You may declare module into several *.ts files, but all of them will contain a common infromation about concrete feature.

To declare module use:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">NotificationManager.ts</div>
```typescript
module NotificationManager {
 // ... 
}
```

To make some content visible and avaliable outside (in specified module), use a following operator:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">NotificationManager.ts</div>
```typescript
export interface INotificationSender {
 // ...
}
```

And in another *.ts file just refer to it like in the same file:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">Another.ts</div>
```typescript
public class NotificationSender implements INotificationSender {
 // ...
}
```

What is more, you may declare not only public classes, interfaces or fucntions, but create a private functinality within module. It is very helpful when you don't want to expose the whole functionality to another developer, just a some part of it.

### Example

Let's see a sample, which shows how does TypeScript modules work.

To start with, we'll have a following project structure:

![project architecture](/images/post/ts-modules-project-structure.png)

*user.ts* file contains a special module:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">models/user.ts</div>
```typescript
/// <reference path='../_all.ts' />

module manager {
    'use strict';
    
    export class User {
        constructor(public Name: string, public Age: number){}
        getInfo = () => {
            return `Name: ${this.Name}, age: ${this.Age}`;
        }
    }
}
```

As you see, we expose class User outside in order to use it in another file. The line *reference* means that we declare a new scope visibility. 

It is very similar to *#include "stdio.h";* (**c++**) or *using System;* (**c#**).

The next file:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">main.ts</div>
```typescript
/// <reference path='_all.ts' />

module manager {
    'use strict';
    
    var u1 = new User("Bob", 20);
    console.log( u1, u1.getInfo() );
}
```

If you were careful and paid attention to the *reference* title, it has the same name - it is a special trick to manage the project reference list in one file:

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">_all.ts</div>
```typescript
/// <reference path='models/user.ts' />
/// <reference path='main.ts' />
```
                
It is not the only one correct methodology, no. But in cases, when you use not a big project with simple structure - it is good way to manage your references, modules and support code.

### Compile sources

And to get a final result we have to compile our *.ts files into *.js files. According to main advices on official TypeScript site, the simpliest way to do this - is using of **tsc** compiler.

1. Install *node.js*.
2. Open terminal -> **npm i typescript -g** (install typescript globally on your PC).
3. To use TS compiler use command **tsc** in terminal with an appropriate flags.

In our case we use the following command:

```bash
tsc --out app1/output.js app1/_all.ts
```

### Grouping references

So, we discussed about working with one reference in your project. If you want to use a lot of modules, classes, interfaces and properly separate them from each other, just use another trick - reference grouping.

> The main idea is categorize all existing references by suitable types and then include them into a special reference file.

In the beginning, let's image we develop a specific *Dispatcher* module to work with user's notification in our application.

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">Project structure</div>

It's just sample directories and files when the main purpose was to show you how you can manage references inside your TypeScript project. 

To see, how it works, compile project (see the point above) and then open an index.html file, thereafter press F12 in your browser (open developer console).

<div align="right" class="highlighter-file-title">Chrome - console output</div>
