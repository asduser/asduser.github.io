<p>Hello to everybody! You are on the site of another software developer.</p>

<p>I have decided to use this engine due to performance, ability of deep customization and, furthermore, it has alot of public modules.</p>

<p>The primary goal of creating this site is a desire to keep my own achievements, in a turn this site is suitable to solve the corresponding tasks!</p>

At the moment, I suggest you to visit the pages of <a href="/works">"projects"</a> and <a href="/about">"about"</a>.
