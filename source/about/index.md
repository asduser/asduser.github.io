title: About Me
---

I'm a certified software engineer and each day of my life I want to improve my personal skills as much as it possible. In software development I'm passionate about network programming. 

I believe that truly useful and high-performance code may be created only due to deep understanding the main problem.

Technologies which I use at the moment and want improve:

1. Node.js.
2. Python.
3. TypeScript, ES5\ES6\ES7.
4. SQL, MongoDB.
5. Golang.

I have a hands-on experience with:

1. **OS**: Windows XP\7\10, Linux(Ubuntu).
2. **Python**: Flask, Bottle, PyMongo.
3. **Node.js**: Express, MongoDB-driver for Node.js.
4. **C#**: ASP.NET MVC\WEB API 2.0, console application-tools.
5. **DataBase**: SQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
6. **Automation**: Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, PowerShell, Bash, Batch, Git, TFS.
7. **Front-End**: ES5\ES6, TypeScript, Angular1\2, Ext.js, D3.js, Google APIs.

Of course, not all technologies were listed above, because in the last time software development is a fast-growing sphere and a lot of new frameworks, tools, languages that become leaders and solve an existing problem a much better.
